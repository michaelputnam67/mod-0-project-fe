## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?
  - In Section 3, I spend more time googling, looking back at notes, and critically thinking about how I would structure a section of code. Overall I felt pretty great about it. I was able to solve the final exercise without having to use any outside resources and I must say that was deeply satisfying.

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
  - Youtube probably has many ways it uses arrays. An array is probably used to build a list of subscribers or a list of channels one is subscribed. Whenever you hit that subscribe button on someones channel you are probably `pushed` into an array that holds all the subscribers for that channel.   

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
  - Array methods are tools built into JavaScript to manipulate arrays. The Method `pop` is designed to remove the final element of an array. The method `unshift` add elements to the beginning of an array. There are many, many different kinds of array methods, but they are all designed to manipulate arrays in some fashion.

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
  - Loops are designed to repeat a piece of code a certain number of times. Loops are really powerful and can be used to perform tasks that would be in possible for humans. By themselves Loops can count to enormous numbers that would take too long for a human to do. In combination with an array they can do a large number of tasks an example is they could check an entire array against various conditions and filter out specific elements of that array.  
5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
  - Simply speaking a loop is how a program counts! If you hold up all ten of your fingers and lower them one at a time until you have no more fingers left that is essentially what a loop does.

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
  - While I was doing the loops exercises I accidentally inputed a condition incorrectly and when I ran it in the terminal it started counting up to infinity forever and I couldn't stop it. I had to force quit the terminal to halt the node program. Is this harmful for my computer? Is all this information stored somewhere?
